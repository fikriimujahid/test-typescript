## Getting started

> IMPORTANT: Our automated scripts to prepare submissions for grading requires the original git history to be retained in your submitted repository. If the script is unable to automatically clone your repository, it will **not be graded and failed immediately**. Steps 1 to 3 will allow you to create a private repo with the original git history :)

As GitHub does not allow the forking of public repos to private repos, what you need to do instead is to clone this repo into a new personal private repo.

### 1. Create a new private repo
When creating a new private repo in GitHub, name the repo any way you like (but preferably `cf-be-take-home-assignment` if you want to follow the instructions below as it is), set it to private, and **do not initialize the repository with anything**.

### 2. Clone this repo to your local filesystem
```
git clone https://github.com/connected-freight/be-take-home-assignment.git cf-be-take-home-assignment
```

### 3. Add your remote and push
Assuming that you are using `cf-be-take-home-assignment` as your repo name:
```
cd cf-be-take-home-assignment
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/cf-be-take-home-assignment.git
git push origin main
```
Now you can work with it just like any other GitHub repo.

### 4. Setup development environment

#### Install development tools
The following tools are required:
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
3. A TypeScript-compatible IDE (We suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

#### Install project dependencies
```
yarn install
```

#### Run tests
```
yarn test
```

## Submission
When you are ready to submit, push all of your changes, and add `calvin@connectedfreight.com` as a collaborator to your repo for grading 😊

Best of luck 👍!
